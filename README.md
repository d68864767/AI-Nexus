# AI Nexus

AI Nexus is an integrated artificial intelligence platform designed to serve as the central hub for diverse AI applications and services. This project aims to provide developers and businesses with a unified environment for managing, deploying, and orchestrating various AI models, fostering collaboration, and simplifying the integration of AI capabilities into applications.

## Project Goals

- Create a centralized platform for managing and deploying a variety of AI models and services.
- Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the AI community.
- Develop an intuitive interface for developers to seamlessly integrate AI into their applications.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- React (or another frontend framework/library)
- Express.js (for the backend API)
- Docker (for containerization of AI models)
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Kubernetes (optional for container orchestration)
- [Any additional libraries or tools]

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key components:

- `/client`: Frontend code for the AI Nexus dashboard.
- `/server`: Backend API built with Express.js.
- `/containerization`: Dockerfiles and configurations for packaging AI models.
- `/orchestration`: Kubernetes configurations for managing containerized AI services.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `/server` directory and run `npm install` to install backend dependencies.
3. Configure your database settings in the server configuration.
4. Run the server with `npm start`.
5. Navigate to the `/client` directory and run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
6. Start the frontend with `npm start`.

## Usage Examples

```javascript
// Example code snippet for integrating with AI Nexus API
const aiNexus = require('ai-nexus');

// List available AI models
const models = aiNexus.listModels();

// Deploy an AI model
aiNexus.deployModel('image-classification', 'v1.0.0');

// Integrate AI model into application
const imageClassificationResult = aiNexus.invokeModel('image-classification', imageData);

console.log(imageClassificationResult);
```
